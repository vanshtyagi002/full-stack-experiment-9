Here’s a high-level step-by-step workflow to **deploy a full stack (React + Node.js/Express + optional MongoDB) app on AWS with load balancing (ALB):**

***

### **Step 1: Prep Your App Locally**
- Build your React frontend (`npm run build`)
- Set up your Node.js/Express backend (API server)
- Optional: Prepare your MongoDB connection URI

***

### **Step 2: Launch EC2 Instances**
- **Backend:** Start 2+ EC2 instances for your Node.js/Express server
- **Frontend:** Start 1 EC2 instance for the React build (served via Nginx or similar)
- Install Node.js, clone your repositories, install dependencies (`npm install`), and start servers

***

### **Step 3: Set Up Security Groups**
- Allow HTTP/HTTPS ports (80, 443) to your instances and ALB
- Backend: Open ports for ALB-to-backend (default 80, or your API port)
- MongoDB (if self-hosted): Open port 27017 but restrict access for security

***

### **Step 4: Configure VPC (default is fine for simple setup)**
- Make sure all EC2 instances and ALB are in the same VPC
- Use public subnets for demo (private for real production setups)

***

### **Step 5: Deploy the App**
- **Backend EC2s:** Start your Express server on each (same code, different instances)
- **Frontend EC2:** Serve the React build using Nginx or serve the static build

***

### **Step 6: Create an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- In AWS Console: EC2 > Load Balancers > Create Load Balancer > Application Load Balancer
- Configure listeners (port 80/443), select the VPC and public subnets
- Register your backend EC2 instances as targets in a target group
- ALB will now distribute API traffic (e.g. `/api`) across your EC2 backend servers

***

### **Step 7: Set Up Domain Routing (Optional, Route 53)**
- Buy a domain or use an existing one
- Route domain to ALB DNS using AWS Route 53 (CNAME/A record pointing to ALB DNS)

***

### **Step 8: Testing**
- Access the frontend app via its public IP or domain.
- API requests from frontend should route through the ALB and be balanced across backend instances.
- Check ALB target health in AWS Console.

***

### **Step 9: Scalability & Fault Tolerance**
- Try stopping a backend EC2: ALB will route traffic to remaining healthy instances.
- Add/remove backend EC2 instances for scaling as needed.

***

**Expected Output:**
- **Your app loads in a browser via public URL**
- **API requests are distributed by ALB**
- **If a backend instance fails, ALB still serves users (high availability)**
